# Project Euler

My solutions to challenges from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Each top-level directory or file corresponds to an exercise number. For
example, the problem statement for `9.py` is
`https://projecteuler.net/problem=9`.

My approach is to come up with *a solution* quickly. When brute force is
reasonable, I'll start there. Then, as needed, I'll refine the solution to be
less computationally complex and/or more elegant. This is not code golf, but I
also don't go out of my way to polish these solutions, though I'll typically
`pep8` or lint them.

Each exercise is written in Python 2 unless otherwise stated.
