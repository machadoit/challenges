# Codewars

My solutions to challenges from [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/).

Each top-level directory corresponds to a problem title.  Inside you'll find my solution (`solution.py`) and sometimes tests (`tests.py`).

For example, the problem [Title Case](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5202ef17a402dd033c000009) is in `/Codewars/Title Case`.

All code is written in Python 3.x unless otherwise stated.
