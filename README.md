My solutions to programming puzzles & challenges.

Each top-level directory corresponds to one site that has challenge problems, and each directory under that is my solution to a particular problem.

<small>_**Disclaimer**: These solutions were developed by me individually unless otherwise stated and are shared for education and curiosity.  Please do not use them as your own.  If you're working on the same problem, please do not view my answer until you've solved it on your own.  If you're working on a related problem, it's generally okay to cite a solution to another problem as a reference._</small>
