# Google Foobar

My solutions to challenges from [Google Foobar](http://www.google.com/foobar/).

Foobar is [an invite-only program](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8588080) which Google unlocks for developers searching for certain advanced programming topics. (They don't clearly spell out the qualification criteria, but I was searching for things like generators, lambdas, and custom decorators.)

## Problems

Each puzzle has three attributes: a level, a time limit, and a tag.

The levels range from 1 to 5.  I completed levels 1â€“2, and started on level 3.

The time limit starts short and increases generously by level.

There are five possible tags (themes):

name        | description
----------- | -----------
algo        | algorithms
data_struct | data structures
low_level   | low-level representation (binary representations, endianness)
math        | math
crypto      | security and cryptography

I did a handful of problems, then got busy with work and other projects. To my own dismay, I learned that Google locks you out of new challenges when you go a few weeks without solving one.

These programs are more useful for viewing vs. running (unless you have the driver program Google uses to run the functions specified).

## Structure

Each top-level directory corresponds to a level with a second-level directory for each problem at that level.
